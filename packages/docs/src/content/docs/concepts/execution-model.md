## Runtime lifecycle

1. Slack sends an event to `/api/webhooks/slack`.
2. Junior validates and routes the event.
3. Thread work is enqueued to `junior-thread-message`.
4. `/api/queue/callback` processes queued work.
5. Agent turn runs with configured tools, loaded skills, and capability gates.
6. If an authenticated command reaches a declared provider domain, the sandbox egress proxy fetches command-scoped requester credentials and injects them at the host boundary.
7. If OAuth is required, Junior sends the link privately to the requesting user and resumes the blocked request after the callback.
8. Reply is posted back to the original Slack thread.

## Why queue-backed processing exists

- Avoids long-running webhook request paths.
- Makes retries explicit and observable.
- Preserves thread execution invariants in background turns.

## Core invariants

- Webhook ingress and queue callback are both required for production.
- Tool usage is turn-scoped; sandbox credential leases are requester-bound and command-scoped.
- Registered plugin providers determine which provider credentials can be injected for matching provider domains.
- Failure states are logged and surfaced for operator recovery.
